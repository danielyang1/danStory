THREE LITTLE HOGS!!!
by Dan Yang

Once upon a time, there lived 3 little hogs. 


They built their houses from 3 different types of 


material in fear of being eaten by a big scary wild dog. 


The first little hoggy built his house from a straw 


like material. When the wild dog came by, he blew


the house down with one mighty breath of air. 

      
That hoggy, scared for his life, ran and stayed 


with his brother, the 2nd hoggy.


The second hoggy built his house from twigs. The 


wolf saw this and blew his house down as well. The two 


terrified hoggies ran and stayed with the 3rd little hoggy.


The third hoggy was the smartest and most 


hardworking of them all because he built his out 

    
of big strong cinder blocks and cement.


It was 


so


so


strong.
